Making Effective Data Visualization on Titanic dataset

This dataset details the information and demographics of 891 passengers travelling in the Titanic ship. Dataset contains information on gender, age, number of family members aboard and class (socio-economic status).  Objective of this visualization is explanatory display of information on passenger survival. 

Summary: First dataset was investigated to select variables, which were related to the passenger survival. This project involves making effective visualization story out of Titanic survival statistics taking into account of different variables such as age group, gender and class. Three graphs were created,

1.	Titanic survival by class - 

2.	Titanic survival by age group – Childrens of 0-15 age group had the highest survival rate.

3.	Titanic survival by class and gender -

Design: 
	Dataset information:  Dataset was edited by removing categories such as passenger name, cabin number, ticket number, fare etc. and a new column was added which grouped passengers age into different age groups. 

Chart type: As the dataset consisted categorical information, bar chart would be better in displaying trends in the titanic survival. Stacked bar chart was chosen to show two catagories of survived or dead.

Legend:

Visual encodings: 

X axis- Class or Age group

Y axis – Percentage of passengers

Color – Survival or Death


Feedback:
#1
What do you notice in the visualization?
Male population had lower survival rate in each cabin class than female.

What questions do you have about the data?
None.

What relationships do you notice?
Survival is dependent upon sex, age and class.

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
If you are female and buy first class ticket you have more chances of survival.

Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
None



#2
What do you notice in the visualization?
Female had higher survival rate than male.

What questions do you have about the data?
None

What relationships do you notice?
In an accident survival  is associated with gender, age and ticket class.

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Visualizations can display whole lot of information in a simple way.

Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
If there were legend for each chart, visualization would have been more effective. It took time to figure out what each graph is conveying.

#3
What do you notice in the visualization?
Female who bought first class cabin ticket survived.

What questions do you have about the data?
None

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
USage of Simple Colors for bars would be more effective.
Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
None.

Changes after feedback:
The initial chart lacked the chart legend. As per suggestions from feedbacks, legends were added to each chart, which made visualization more effective. Colors of the bars were altered choosing simple colors.
